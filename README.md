# LED_Wizard

LED_Wizard allows control over the RGB_LED's intensity and color. This project uses 3 potentiometers (One for Red, Green and Blue) at the input pins connected to 5V and ground from the microntrontoller. Turning the knob of the potentiometer allows the microcontroller to read in changes in the input voltage. The microcontroller processes the input to delever the correct output votlage on the ouput pins. Each output pin (to control red, green, and blue) are connected to a resistor to delever current to the RGB_LED, controlling its intensity and color.
